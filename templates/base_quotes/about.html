                                 defines an application programming interface (API) as a way for two or more
                                computer programs or components to communicate with each other. It is a type
                                of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1]
                                A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or
                                interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this
                                standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either
                                to the specification or to the implementation. Whereas a system's user interface
                                dictates how its end-users interact with the system in question, its API dictates
                                how to write code that takes advantage of that system's capabilities.

                                It's an old project that started with the freeCodeCamp frontend quote machine project.
                                After completing that project I did the proejct again in python, storing hundreds of quotes in
                                a CVS. After learning the basics of the Django Rest Framework, I wanted to make the quotes
                                available to anyone that wanted another data set to practice on.
